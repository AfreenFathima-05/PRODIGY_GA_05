Neural Style Transfer

Description:

This task applies the artistic style of one image to another image using Neural Style Transfer technique.


Tools & Technologies:

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
VGG19 (Pre-trained CNN)


Working:

A content image and a style image are given as input.
VGG19 model extracts content and style features.
The model combines both features to generate a new stylized image.


Input:

Content Image
Style Image


Output:

A new image that preserves the content of the original image and adopts the artistic style of the style image.


Result:

Neural Style Transfer successfully generates an artistic image by blending content and style using deep learning.
